        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sabzi Polo is a Persian Herb Rice dish filled with a whole bunch of fresh herbs. 
            It becomes a beautiful green colour and tastes and smells incredible!</p>

        <p>We traditionally make Sabzi Polo for <strong>Nowruz</strong> (Persian New Year) 
            along with ash reshteh (Persian noodle soup) which is at the end of March every year. 
            However, it tastes that good and is pretty easy to make so 
            youâ€™ll want to eat it all year round ðŸ™‚</p>

            <li>2 fresh spring garlic stalks (Optional)</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup boiling water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare herbs.</strong> Remove the parsley and dill leaves from the stems along with the thick coriander stems. 
                Finely chop all the herbs and spring onions and mix together in a bowl</li>
            <li><p><strong>Cook rice.</strong> Place the rice in a non stick pot and rinse with water about 5 times until the water is mostly clear. 
                Fill the pot with water, add the salt and cook on a medium-high heat for about 10-15 minutes</p>
                <p>Cook the rice until al dente (it should be half way cooked when you touch a rice grain between your fingers).  
                    Then drain the rice through a colander and gently rinse under cold water</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Time to layer.</strong> Start by adding olive oil to the same rice pot 
                and place flat bread in the pot to cover the bottom</p>
                <p>Add a layer of rice, approximately â…“ of the rice and top with â…“ of the herb mix. 
                    Add a teaspoon of the bloomed saffron and advieh (if using)</p>
                <p>Chop the top of the garlic head off so the tops are visible but still intact.  
                    Place in the middle of the rice and then repeat the layering of rice and herbs until all used</p>
                    <p>With the handle of a spoon, make 6 holes into the rice down to the bottom of the pot. 
                        These will act as air pockets (as per picture 7)</p>   
                    <p>Wrap the lid with a clean kitchen towel, 
                        place on the pot and cook on low heat for 30 minute</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Serve it up.</strong>
                Take off the heat, remove the lid and gently flip the pot upside down on a large platter. 
                This can be done by placing the platter on the top of the pot and flipping it upside down. 
                Cut out pieces of the Tahdig (crispy base) to share evenly, serve and enjoy your Sabzi Polo</p></li>
